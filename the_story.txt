Once upon a time


There was a dragon, and a Dover Demon walking around Dover, Massachusetts.

There was also a group of Mokele-Mbembe but they had previously became extinct.
The dragon breathed his firey breath
The Dover Demon was terrorizing people with it's large head and tendril-like fingers. 
As the dust settled, he realized that the city of Wyndoughs was destroyed when he froze his adversaries.
Gliding over the city on his teratorn, Wilhelm Gaets, leader of Clan McRhosopht, ordered the Wyndoughs Defenders--a group of eight inflatable hedgehogs disguised as chupacabras--to terminate Agent Buckwald at any cost.
Then, Agent Buckwald the Wizard appeared and froze the dragon and Dover Demon.
To pass the time, the wizard decided to do some logic design, because he felt like he needed to further add to his insanity.
The wizard used all of his energy keeping them frozen, waiting until a worthy hero would rise up to slay them.
A noble hero stumbled upon the frozen foes and thought to himself, “If only I were 20 years younger, I could slay these here vermin and relive my days of glory!” 
Little did he know that Agent Buckwald the wizard had secretly been working on to form a Link to the Past.

The noble hero, Zelda, and the wizard formed an allegiance and began work on a Temple of Time.
The reader soon realized that this was not a video game, but the story must continue....It was in this temple of time the two hoped they could send our noble hero in his green pointed hat back in time. 
Agent Buckwald the Wizard and Zelda worked hard on finding a way to send Zelda back 20 years to slay the dragon. 
While in the lab, Agent Buckwald noted 'You look familiar.... Isn't your name actually Link...?' 
Zelda replied...Uhh, I do not think you know what that word means.

I know I have to wirte something in there,however, I can not figure out what i should write to continue this story
Agent Buckwald soon realized that it wasn't Link that he was dealing with, but it was the Sasquatch
 Sasquatch was really a member of the hairy humanoids.

The end.
